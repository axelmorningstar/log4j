# Detection

## Test apps for log4shell vuln

https://twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1469405846010572816

### Manual
1. Generate a DNS token https://canarytokens.org/generate#
2. Wrap that token in 
Prefix: ${jndi:ldap://
Suffix: /a}
3. Use that value in search forms, profile data, settings etc. of your apps
4. Get notified when you triggered a reaction

### Automatic:
https://twitter.com/ThinkstCanary/status/1469439743905697797
You can use a point & click canarytoken from https://canarytokens.org to help test for the #log4j  / #Log4Shell issue.

1) visit https://canarytokens.org;
2) choose the Log4shell token;
3) enter the email address you wish to be notified at;
4) copy/use the returned string...

## Detection alternative (fast)
How to detect if affected: Start netcat parallel to your app: "nc -lp 1234", then type the following into app where it gets logged (e.g. the query string of your search): "${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1:1234/abc}" If you then see garbage/emojis in the netcat console your're vulnerable!

# Mitigation:
I've written a simple (i.e. standalone, no dependencies) Java program which patches JndiLookup.lookup() to return a fixed string and not parse its arguments. This should fix CVE-2021-44228 (i.e. RCE in Log4j) without restarting your JVM process.
https://github.com/simonis/Log4jPatch

#Partial Mitigation:
- Users should switch log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups to true by adding:"‚ÄêDlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=True" to the JVM command for starting the application
* Disabling lookups at the command line is partial mitigation in some of these cases (doesn't require vendor action, but may screw up the app's logging if it actually uses the feature -- and of course, requires local admins to control the command line).

# Patching
- Upgrade log4j versions to log4j-2.15.0-rc1
