# Log4J Zero-Day
Compilation of log4j OSINT findings, including Detection, Attack Surface, Mitigation, IoCs.
# I. Overview
## Affected versions:
- Apache Log4j v2.0 -> v2.14.1
- Anyone using Apache Struts framework is likely vulnerable

## Testing apps for log4shell vuln
### a) Canarytokens
#### Automatic:
https://twitter.com/ThinkstCanary/status/1469439743905697797
You can use a point & click canarytoken from https://canarytokens.org to help test for the #log4j  / #Log4Shell issue.

1) visit https://canarytokens.org;
2) choose the Log4shell token;
3) enter the email address you wish to be notified at;
4) copy/use the returned string...

#### Manual
1. Generate a DNS token https://canarytokens.org/generate#
2. Wrap that token in 
Prefix: ${jndi:ldap://
Suffix: /a}
3. Use that value in search forms, profile data, settings etc. of your apps
4. Get notified when you triggered a reaction

## Snort and Suricata detection

## Detection alternative with netcat
"How to detect if affected: Start netcat parallel to your app: "nc -lp 1234", then type the following into app where it gets logged (e.g. the query string of your search): "${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1:1234/abc}" If you then see garbage/emojis in the netcat console your're vulnerable!"

# III. Mitigation:
## 1. Permanent mitigation (Patching)
- Upgrade log4j versions to log4j-2.15.0-rc1
-   URL: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-core/2.15.0/
-   Release notes: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.15.0
-   Announcement: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html

## 2. Temporary/partial mitigation
### a) Partial Mitigation:
- Users should switch log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups to true by adding:"‚ÄêDlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=True" to the JVM command for starting the application
* Disabling lookups at the command line is partial mitigation in some of these cases (doesn't require vendor action, but may screw up the app's logging if it actually uses the feature -- and of course, requires local admins to control the command line).

### b) Partial mitigation
"I've written a simple (i.e. standalone, no dependencies) Java program which patches JndiLookup.lookup() to return a fixed string and not parse its arguments. This should fix CVE-2021-44228 (i.e. RCE in Log4j) without restarting your JVM process."
https://github.com/simonis/Log4jPatch
"This is a POC of a simple tool which injects a Java agent into a running JVM process. The agent will patch the lookup() method of all loaded org.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup instances to unconditionally return the string "Patched JndiLookup::lookup()". This should fix the CVE-2021-44228 remote code execution vulnerability in Log4j without restarting the Java process.
This has been currently only tested with JDK 8 & 11!"
